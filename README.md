### USING TEST_VIDEO_CONTENT: 

- make sure to paste the test_video_content into the directory /output/video_ZpsDvANs_test/{here}
- I have not yet updated the video content such that the methods like get image directory work 
  - this is because when running originally, it put the images there and saved the wrong image directory
